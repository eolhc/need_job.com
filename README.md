The Most Fly Dog is a flying dog named Dogg, who wishes to buy a burger. Buying a burger requires human money. Where does human money seem to appear and disappear from? Well, Dogg sniffed it out to be none other than Wall Street. Your goal is to guide Dogg over Wall Street is his quest to collect 10 moneyz! Avoid getting stabbed and robbed. Get 10, get BURGER!

## why 

For the final project in my programming bootcamp, we were given the choice of creating "whatever we want". I want to create lots of things but, eventually, settled on my most recent interest, three.js. Actually, I had wanted to use whitestorm.js but given that we only had a few days to pull something together, I went with three.js. There's way more info out there!

## why a flying dog who buys a burger

Do you ever feel sorry for animals who are not exposed to capitalism and the power of money and being able to independently buy delicious foods?

Yes, other species have money. 
I have yet to model a 3D burger.
I have yet to decide whether the burger will actually be delicious.
